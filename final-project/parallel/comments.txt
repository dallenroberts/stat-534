The results of the program are stored in a text file called "bestregressions.txt".

On my last parallelized run, these were my results using 10,000 iterations for both Monte Carlo integration and the Metropolis Hastings algorithm. 10,000 runs isn't quite enough to be completely stable, though - I've had some iterations return regression 42 instead of 21, or 42 instead of 1. This occurred occasionally even when I increased the numbeor of iterations to 100,000. Since we are ordering based on the Monte Carlo integration estimate of the log marginal likelihood, the ordering may differ for each run.

j indexes the column of the dataset (1:60)
lml_mc = Log marginal likelihood estimated by Monte Carlo integration
lml_la = Log marginal likelihood estimated by Laplace approximation
b0 = Metropolis-Hastings coefficient estimate for intercept (beta0)
b1 = Metropolis-Hastings coefficient estimate for predictor (beta1)

j		lml_mc		lml_la		b0			b1
23		-79.415		-79.484		-0.901		1.244
37		-83.489		-83.421		-0.847		1.018
22		-84.134		-84.037		-0.837		0.976
1		-84.206		-84.170		-0.758		1.014
21		-85.740		-85.747		-0.821		0.893
